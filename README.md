### Description

What's life without a little RISC? This miniature dev board is perfect for small projects: it comes with our favorite connector - the STEMMA QT, a chainable I2C port, WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and plenty of FLASH and RAM memory for many IoT projects. What a cutie pie! Or is it... a QT Py? This diminutive dev board comes with a RISC-V IoT microcontroller, the ESP32-C3!

ESP32-C3 is a low-cost microcontroller from Espressif that supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It has built-in USB-to-Serial, but not native USB - it cannot act as a keyboard or disk drive. The chip used here has 4MB of Flash memory, 400 KB of SRAM and can easily handle TLS connections.

The ESP32-C3 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from UART, I2C, I2S, remote control peripheral, LED PWM controller, general DMA controller, TWAI controller, USB Serial/JTAG controller, temperature sensor, and ADC. It also includes SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI interfaces. There is no DAC or native capacitive touch.

There's a minimum number of pins on this chip, it's specifically designed to be low cost and for simpler projects than ESP32-Sx or ESP32 classics with their large number of GPIO. Think of it more as an intended replacement to the ESP8266 than to the ESP32!

With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics, and smart homes.
